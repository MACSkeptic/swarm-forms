# swarm forms

swarm forms is a project we created to experiment with game mechanics and canvas.

a live version (may not be the latest) of this can be found at: http://swarm-forms.herokuapp.com/

## premises

most of it is focused on creating things from scratch instead of relying on engines
and frameworks.

the reasoning behind it is by no means because we think that is necessarily the best
approach, but instead it forces us to learn about problems and solutions that are
specific to game development.

## inspiration sources

some things that greatly influenced us from design, mechanics and just from being flat out awe inspiring artistic pieces:

* binding of isaac
* cave story (+ soundtrack)
